# railway-deno-redis-crudapi

- Small project to showcase a CRUD API written in Deno, using Redis for persistence. 
- It's intended to be easily deployable via a Railway template, which will be utilized in [@jojobii-arks/yafr](https://github.com/jojobii-arks/yafr).
- Could this API be serverless? Yeah, but I do need access to Web Workers .3.
